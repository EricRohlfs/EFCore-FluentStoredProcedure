# Fork

This is a fork of Snickler.EFCore that is not fluent.
It has interfaces for unit tests.

Honestly, I recomend using dapper or petapoco for calling stored procedures when using entityframework Core.

Dapper if you need to map to more than one result set.


The code was brought in from another solution, so the files are there, but this solution file is not 100% setup.
